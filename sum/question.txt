Problem: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Write a program that:
1. Takes an integer input from the user
2. Determines whether the number is even or odd
3. Returns true if the number is even
4. Returns false if the number is odd

Input Format:
- A single integer n

Output Format:
- Print "true" if the number is even
- Print "false" if the number is odd

Example:
Input: 4
Output: true

Input: 7
Output: false

Note:
- The program should use a method called isEven() to check if the number is even
- The method should return a boolean value
- Use the modulo operator (%) to determine if a number is even
